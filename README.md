# üõ†Ô∏è HOW IT'S MADE

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React on the frontend. Docker Compose, Node, and Rust on the backend.
<br></br>

I started with the backend. The env setup required Docker Compose, Node.js, Rust, Terrain and LocalTerra. This project explores the Terra blockchain so in order to deploy and test my smart contract, I used Terrain - a development environment easily accessible from the terminal. I used LocalTerra to run a local version of the Terra network to easily test my smart contract as I build. Next, I used Rust to write the smart contract for the game. I compiled the Rust code into WASM bytecode so it could run on Terra's blockchain. 
<br></br>

Now that I have a smart contract I can read and write data to, I move on to the frontend. I start by adding the Terra wallet provider so users can connect their wallet. From here I setup the menu using React Router and create the pages for the web app. Lastly, I write the logic to read and write data from my smart contract before polishing any last details and deploying the app.

# üöÄ OPTIMIZATIONS

This project was originally built in 2022. To optimize it, I plan to refactor using Next.js for page componenets, pre-rendering, and other funtionality improvements. I'd also switch from the Terra blockchain to the Solana blockchain.

# ü§ì LESSONS LEARNED

Throughout this build, I was introduced to Docker Compose and COSMWASM. I learned the basics of Terra blockchain and expanded my Rust knowledge.
